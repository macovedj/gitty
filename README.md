# Gitty

An app for collaborative text editing in a git repo in the browser.
No more need for local code, use git commands like `add` and `commit` in the browser while collaborating with teammates in real time.
Lots of lines of code game straight from [Alchemy-book](https://github.com/rudi-c/alchemy-book), which is inspired by the
LOGOOT implementation of a crdt.  Very much a work in progress.

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install` inside the `assets` directory
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
